# Food Supply
This repo is for a data science project for my course at Universit√† degli Studi di Udine.  
Content is in Italian.

The project is done in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Using FAO data, a simple analysis of international food supply is presented.  
Initially some general considerations are made and then some relevant cases are analyzed.  
The second part of the presentation is dedicated to food production and deals with the related issues of sustainability and climate change.
