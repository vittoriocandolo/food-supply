# Food Supply
This repo is for a data science project for my course at Università degli Studi di Udine.  
Content is in Italian.

The project is done in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Using FAO data, a simple analysis of international food supply is presented.  
Initially some general considerations are made and then some relevant cases are analyzed.  
The final part of the presentation is dedicated to the related issues of sustainability and climate change.
